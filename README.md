# Fundamentals of Data Analysis 2020, Tasks assessment. - Authored by Leonard Curtin

## Contained within the Jupyter notebook are solutions to the four tasks assigned. The Python programming language was used throughout the notebook.
<hr>

The python code was written in version 3.8 which was downloaded from https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/ . This open-source Anaconda individual Edition comes with several python libraries. 
Within the notebook, several of these libraries have been imported.
Namely the usage of such modules occured.

Python random module - https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html
NumPy - https://numpy.org/doc/stable/
Seaborn - https://seaborn.pydata.org/index.html
Matplotlib - https://matplotlib.org/index.html

Importation and utilisaton of these libraries occured through the commands below
``` python
import random
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt 
import numpy as np
import seaborn as sns
```
# Depicted below is a brief explanation of the various tasks.
## Task 1: 5th October - Creation of function called "counts"¶
The aim of the following task is to create a function that takes a list as an input and returns a dictionary of unique items in the list as keys and the number of times each item appears as values.

## Task 2: 2nd November - Creation of function called "dicerolls"¶
The aim of the following task is to create a function, that simulates dice rolling.

## Task 3: 16th November - Flipping a coin simulation¶
Usage of a random number generator to create a simulation of flipping a coin. This occured through the usage of the numpy.random sub package of the numpy library. Samples were drawn from a binomial distribution in order to simulate a coin landing on heads or tails.

## Task 4: 30th November - Simpson's Paradox¶
The intention of the following task is to create four data sets that will convey the phenomenon of Simpson's Paradox i.e. Where a trend evident in a number of groups reverses when the groups are combined and conveyed as one data set.
